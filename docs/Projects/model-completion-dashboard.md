Model Completion Dashboard
==========================

This is one possible interface that will display the results of the [unifying modeling activity](Projects/muscle-neuron-integration/).

This interface allows a user to drill down into our model, and view the states of completion of modeled components at each level. At the highest level, matrices display, using a color indicator, the level of completion of each cell in the model.

By clicking one of these cells, the section below focuses on that cell. Ion channels that exist in that cell are displayed in a grid with completion coloring, and simulation/experimental data for the cell is compared in plots.

Individual ion channels can be clicked on and selected from the grid, with parameters and simulation/experimental comparison plots available.

Rolling over the data displayed at each level gives information about the references for that particular piece of data.
