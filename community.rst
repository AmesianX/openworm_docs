Contribution Best Practices
===========================

Using OpenWorm repos on GitHub
------------------------------

More details on best practices using OpenWorm repos on GitHub are available :ref:`on a separate page <github>`.

Creating organizing documents
-----------------------------

To contribute documentation and materials to the OpenWorm Google Drive, log into your Gmail account and click on 
`this link <https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_t3mQaA-HaMaXpxVW5BY2JLa1E&usp=sharing>`_.

All documents located in the OpenWorm folder is viewable to the public.  Comments can be added to both text 
documents and spreadsheets.  In order to edit existing documents or to add a new document, you will need to be 
added to the folder.  You can request access by email your Google ID to info@openworm.org. 

.. Spreadsheets, slide presentation, dynamic documents - should be on google drive (policy of what goes in)
.. Folder structure w/ descriptors

Meetings
--------

Team meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have `a regular meeting <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IyHokN8FkA&list=PL8ACJC0fGE7C7zlCBqkx1LMN1DHGKVp22>`_ 
of the team that is building applications every two weeks.  
We also currently
schedule an ad-hoc `data team meeting <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seKjRnw7CB8&list=PL8ACJC0fGE7CGtyJWV2dPOfNxAruk2VcM>`_ 
about every 3-4 weeks.  The events
are on `our community calendar <https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=bqvlrm642m3irjehbethokkcdg%40group.calendar.google.com>`_.  
The events are streamed live when they occur and an archive of the meeting videos
and `the minutes <https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B8QUskXehbJtNWM2MjUyM2EtOTMxMC00MWY3LWEyNWMtNDUwMjRiNjM0Mjcx>`_
are kept online.

Working meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contributors are encouraged to meet with each other on a regular basis to advance areas of 
the project they need interaction on.  

IRC meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We had been running meetings on IRC for some time but have currently discontinued the 
practice.  If there is interest in reviving this, please post on 
`the mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openworm-discuss>`_.

Scheduling meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We like using the `Doodle service <doodle.com>`_ for scheduling meetings.  This makes it easy to find
times to meet across various time zones.  Once a meeting is scheduled, we will often create
a Google+ event to track it and remind everyone it is occurring.

Guest Blog Post
---------------
We love hearing about what members are of the OpenWorm community are doing.  
If you have something to share, contact us at info@openworm.org to discuss.


Journal Clubs
-------------
Every few months an academic journal article comes along we can't resist talking about. 
We host a journal club where we invite scientists to present on the paper and to host a 
discussion about it, hopefully with some of the article authors.

You can see 
`past journal clubs we have conducted online 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHSqkZ2sFDA&list=PL8ACJC0fGE7D-EkkR7EFgQESpHONC_kcI>`_.

If you have an idea for a good journal club, please post the suggestion 
`on our mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openworm-discuss>`_.
