A History and Pre-History of OpenWorm
=====================================

What follows is a history of *C. elegans* research, of the OpenWorm
Project, as well as of several similar projects.

Historical Milestones
---------------------

1900: ***C. elegans*** was `first
described <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans>`__
by Émile Maupas, who isolated it from soil in Algeria.

1963: **Sydney Brenner**, at MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, `**proposed
using *C. elegans* as a model
organism** <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans>`__
for scientific study. He won a Nobel prize for this work in 2002.

1986: After thirteen years of work, **John White**, also at MRC
Laboratory in Cambridge, `publishes **the full *C. elegans*
connectome** <http://www.wormatlas.org/ver1/MoW_built0.92/toc.html>`__.

2000: `**WormBase** <http://www.wormbase.org/about#0--10>`__ is
`founded <http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/suppl_1/D463.abstract>`__
by Paul Sternberg of CalTech and Richard Durbin, among others. It
aggregates information known about *C. elegans* into one place.

| 2009 **Jordan Boyle, Netta Cohen at University of Leeds, UK**
| `C. elegans locomotion: an integrated
approach <http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jboyle/JordanBoyle_files/J_Boyle_PhD.pdf>`__

2010 **Mailler at Tulsa, USA** `A Biologically Accurate 3D Model of the
Locomotion of Caenorhabditis
Elegans <http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~roger-mailler/publications/BIOSYSCOM2010.pdf>`__.

18 May 2014: `A team from MIT develops a technique to **view all C.
elegans neurons at
once** <http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2964.html>`__,
which may fill in a remaining data gap.

OpenWorm
--------

~2007: Co-founders Giovanni Idili and Matteo Cantarelli have
conversations about simulating the worm, but nothing comes of it at the
time.

3 August 2010: In a `five-minute
speech <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb1V_OKqRfc>`__, Stephen Larson
pitches the idea for simulating *C. elegans* at `Ignite San
Diego <http://ignitesandiego.org/>`__.

1 Jan 2011: In `the tweet heard 'round the
world <http://www.sciencetogrok.com/2013/03/a-great-role-model-for-collaborative.html>`__,
co-founder `Giovanni Idili <http://twitter.com/john_idol>`__ **proposes
what would later be called the OpenWorm project** to co-founder Stephen
Larson at the `Whole Brain Catalog <http://twitter.com/BrainCatalog>`__:

| 24 Jan 2011: Giovanni discovers **Sibernetic**, a physics simulation
of *C. elegans* developed by future OpenWorm team members **Andrey
Palyanov** and **Sergey Khayrulin**:
| WOW, this C.Elegans simulation looks pretty impressive -->

Projects similar to OpenWorm
----------------------------

~1997: **NemaSys at University of Oregon** A full model was planned,
including body, every neuron, every synapse, and complete set of sensory
modalities. No paper was ever published. `Webpage
link <http://www.csi.uoregon.edu/projects/celegans/>`__

| ~1998 **Perfect C. elegans Project in Tokyo**
| They released an initial report, but no more.

| ~2004 **Virtual C. Elegans project at Hiroshima University, Japan**
| The aim was to build a worm emulation, simulate poking it on the head,
and have it back away from the poke. This was achieved, but not in a
biologically realistic way. They simulated the nematode neurons, but the
connection weights were unknown. Instead of getting this information
experimentally, a machine learning algorithm was used to generate
weights. Papers:

-  `A Dynamic Body Model of C. elegans with Neural
   Oscillators <http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf>`__
-  `A model of motor control of C. elegans with neuronal
   circuits <http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf>`__

| September 2011 - October 2013 **`Project
Nemaload <http://nemaload.davidad.org/>`__ (`David
Dalrymple <http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/144/26>`__)**.
| The aim was to use optogenetics to record the firing dynamics of the
**C. elegans** neurons and then replicate it in a simulation. `He
delivered a lecture on the project in November
2011 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW77lANeJas>`__. `As of June 2014
he works for
Twitter <https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=66199655>`__ so it
seems the project is defunct.
