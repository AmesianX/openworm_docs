#A History and Pre-History of OpenWorm#

What follows is a history of *C. elegans* research, of the OpenWorm Project, as well as of several similar projects.

##Historical Milestones##

1900: ***C. elegans*** was [first described](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans) by Ã‰mile Maupas, who isolated it from soil in Algeria.

1963: **Sydney Brenner**, at MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, [**proposed using *C. elegans* as a model organism**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans) for scientific study.  He won a Nobel prize for this work in 2002.

1986: After thirteen years of work, **John White**, also at MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, [publishes **the full *C. elegans* connectome**](http://www.wormatlas.org/ver1/MoW_built0.92/toc.html).

1999: *C. elegans* becomes the first animal [to have its genome completely sequenced](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/caenorhabditisgenomics/).  Humans follow in 2002.

2000: [**WormBase**](http://www.wormbase.org/about#0--10) is [founded](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/suppl_1/D463.abstract) by Paul Sternberg of CalTech and Richard Durbin, among others.  It aggregates information known about *C. elegans* into one place.

18 May 2014: [A team from MIT develops a technique to **view all C. elegans neurons at once**](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2964.html), which may fill in a remaining data gap.


##OpenWorm##

~2007: Co-founders Giovanni Idili and Matteo Cantarelli have conversations about simulating the worm, but nothing comes of it at the time.

3 August 2010: In a [five-minute speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb1V_OKqRfc), Stephen Larson pitches the idea for simulating *C. elegans* at [Ignite San Diego](http://ignitesandiego.org/).

1 Jan 2011: In [the tweet heard 'round the world](http://www.sciencetogrok.com/2013/03/a-great-role-model-for-collaborative.html), co-founder [Giovanni Idili](http://twitter.com/john_idol) **proposes what would later be called the OpenWorm project** to co-founder Stephen Larson at the [Whole Brain Catalog](http://twitter.com/BrainCatalog):

24 Jan 2011: Giovanni discovers **CyberElegans**, a physics simulation of *C. elegans* developed by future OpenWorm team members **Andrey Palyanov** and **Sergey Khayrulin**:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>WOW, this C.Elegans simulation looks pretty impressive --&gt; http://goo.gl/SS96B cc: <a href="https://twitter.com/BrainCatalog">@BrainCatalog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tarelli">@tarelli</a></p>&mdash; Giovanni Idili (@John_Idol) <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Idol/status/29603680760111104">January 24, 2011</a></blockquote>

##Projects similar to OpenWorm##

[Detailed spreadsheet of these models and their attributes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NclOVMRIqY_hn-aL8MdLlJrfuhDgNJyk_ChsZMjugmE/edit#gid=0)

1991: **Neibur and Erdos** develop the first standard CBM (Cuticle with internal fluid Pressure, body-wall muscle) model, in a series of two papers.  It was a mathematical model only:

- [Theory of the locomotion of nematodes: dynamics of undulatoy progression on a surface](http://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ipKi9CIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ipKi9CIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC)

1997: **NemaSys at University of Oregon**  A full model was planned, including body, every neuron, every synapse, and complete set of sensory modalities.  Four papers were released in 1997-1998 on pieces of the model, but its ultimate ambition was not finished. [Webpage link](http://www.csi.uoregon.edu/projects/celegans/)

~1998 **Perfect C. elegans Project in Tokyo**
They released [an initial report](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/106454698568495#.VDrtDfldV8E), but no more.

~2004 **Virtual C. Elegans project at Hiroshima University, Japan**
The aim was to build a worm emulation, simulate poking it on the head, and have it back away from the poke. This was achieved, but not in a biologically realistic way. They simulated the nematode neurons, but the connection weights were unknown. Instead of getting this information experimentally, a machine learning algorithm was used to generate weights. Papers:

- [A Dynamic Body Model of C. elegans with Neural Oscillators](http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf)
- [A Model of Motor Control of C. elegans with Neuronal Circuits](http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf)

2009 **Jordan Boyle, Netta Cohen at University of Leeds, UK**
[C. elegans locomotion: an integrated approach](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jboyle/JordanBoyle_files/J_Boyle_PhD.pdf)

2010 **Mailler at Tulsa, USA** [A Biologically Accurate 3D Model of the Locomotion of Caenorhabditis Elegans](http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~roger-mailler/publications/BIOSYSCOM2010.pdf).

September 2011 - October 2013 **[Project Nemaload](http://nemaload.davidad.org/) ([David Dalrymple](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/144/26))**.
The aim was to use optogenetics to record the firing dynamics of the **C. elegans** neurons and then replicate it in a simulation.  [He delivered a lecture on the project in November 2011](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW77lANeJas).  [As of June 2014 he works for Twitter](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=66199655) so it seems the project is defunct.
