Other Ways to Share
===================

Guest Blog Post
---------------
We love hearing about what members are of the OpenWorm community are doing.  If you have something to share, 
contact us at info@openworm.org to discuss.


Journal Clubs
-------------
Every few months an academic journal article comes along we can't resist talking about. We host a journal 
club where we invite scientists to present on the paper and to host a discussion about it, hopefully with 
some of the article authors.

You can see past journal clubs we have conducted online.

The next journal club is not yet scheduled, but if you have suggestions, please reach out and let us know on 
our various social media channels.
