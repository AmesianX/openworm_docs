ChannelWorm
===========

`The ChannelWorm subproject <https://github.com/VahidGh/ChannelWorm/>`_ is, at a
high level, a pipeline to convert ion channel *data* found in scientific papers
into ion channel *models*. This pipeline involves:

1. `Identification <https://github.com/VahidGh/ChannelWorm/issues/10/>`_ of papers with ion channel data.
2. Extraction of data from these papers, including figures, active parameters and tabular data.
3. `Digitization <https://github.com/VahidGh/ChannelWorm/issues/17/>`_ of figures, and more generally, converting this information into machine-readable form.

..
  4. Fitting of models (to what? Is this part of the pipeline or validation process?)
