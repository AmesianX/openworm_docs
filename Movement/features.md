TODO: Eventually it would be nice to have a list and some illustration via data

A better list is available in the Nature Methods paper.

A brief list (not yet exhaustive):
- egg laying
- omega bends
- pirouettes
- coiled shapes
- defecation
- morphology
  - length and width at various locations
  - area within its contour
  - width/length
  - area/length
