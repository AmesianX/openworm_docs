A History and Pre-History of OpenWorm
=====================================

What follows is a history of *C. elegans* research, of the OpenWorm
Project, as well as of several similar projects.

Historical Milestones
---------------------

1900: *C. elegans* was `first
described <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans>`__
by Ã‰mile Maupas, who isolated it from soil in Algeria.

1963: **Sydney Brenner**, at MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, `**proposed
using *C. elegans* as a model
organism** <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_research_on_Caenorhabditis_elegans>`__
for scientific study. He won a Nobel prize for this work in 2002.

1986: After thirteen years of work, **John White**, also at MRC
Laboratory in Cambridge, `publishes the full *C. elegans*
connectome <http://www.wormatlas.org/ver1/MoW_built0.92/toc.html>`__.

1999: *C. elegans* becomes the first animal `to have its genome completely sequenced <http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/caenorhabditisgenomics>`__.
Humans follow in 2002.

2000: `**WormBase** <http://www.wormbase.org/about#0--10>`__ is
`founded <http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/suppl_1/D463.abstract>`__
by Paul Sternberg of CalTech and Richard Durbin, among others. It
aggregates information known about *C. elegans* into one place.

18 May 2014: `A team from MIT develops a technique to **view all C.
elegans neurons at
once** <http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2964.html>`__,
which may fill in a remaining data gap.

OpenWorm
--------

~2007: Co-founders Giovanni Idili and Matteo Cantarelli (software engineers) have
conversations about simulating the worm, but nothing comes of it at the
time as they lack computational biology / neuroscience background.

1 Jan 2010: In `the tweet heard 'round the
world <http://www.sciencetogrok.com/2013/03/a-great-role-model-for-collaborative.html>`__,
co-founder `Giovanni Idili <http://twitter.com/john_idol>`__ **proposes
what would later be called the OpenWorm project** to co-founder Stephen
Larson (PhD student at UCSD) at the `Whole Brain Catalog <http://twitter.com/BrainCatalog>`__:

3 August 2010: In a `five-minute
speech <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb1V_OKqRfc>`__, Stephen Larson
pitches the idea for simulating *C. elegans* at `Ignite San
Diego <http://ignitesandiego.org/>`__.

Early Jan 2011: Stephen Larson puts out a call for volunteers through Whole Brain Catalog, originally oriented at finding contributors for the WBC platform.
Giovanni and Matteo reply to the call restating their goal of C. elegans simulation. The 3 get together on a skype call and decide to start a project together, during this conversation **Stephen proposes the name "OpenWorm" and the name sticks**.
Subsequent early days conversations include Timothy Busbice (who also replied to Stephen's call for volunteers), Marius Buibas (UCSD at the time) and Jay Coggan (Salk Institute).

24 Jan 2011: Giovanni discovers **Sibernetic**, a physics simulation
of *C. elegans* developed by **Andrey
Palyanov** and **Sergey Khayrulin** (from AP Ershov Institute of Informatics, Russia) who are contacted and immediately agree to join forces with the OpenWorm team:

Projects similar to OpenWorm
----------------------------

`Detailed spreadsheet of these models and their attributes <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NclOVMRIqY_hn-aL8MdLlJrfuhDgNJyk_ChsZMjugmE/edit?usp=sharing>`

~1997: **NemaSys at University of Oregon**  A full model was planned, including body, every neuron,
every synapse, and complete set of sensory modalities.  Four papers were released in 1997-1998 on
pieces of the model, but its ultimate ambition was not finished. `Webpage link <http://www.csi.uoregon.edu/projects/celegans/>`__

~1998 **Perfect C. elegans Project in Tokyo**
They released an `initial report <http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/106454698568495#.VDrtDfldV8E>`, but no more.

~2004 **Virtual C. Elegans project at Hiroshima University, Japan**
The aim was to build a worm emulation, simulate poking it on the head,
and have it back away from the poke. This was achieved, but not in a
biologically realistic way. They simulated the nematode neurons, but the
connection weights were unknown. Instead of getting this information
experimentally, a machine learning algorithm was used to generate
weights. Papers:

-  `A Dynamic Body Model of C. elegans with Neural
   Oscillators <http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf>`__
-  `A Model of Motor Control of C. elegans with Neuronal
   Circuits <http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf>`__

2009 **Jordan Boyle, Netta Cohen at University of Leeds, UK**
`C. elegans locomotion: an integrated
approach <http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jboyle/JordanBoyle_files/J_Boyle_PhD.pdf>`__

2010 **Mailler at Tulsa, USA** `A Biologically Accurate 3D Model of the
Locomotion of Caenorhabditis
Elegans <http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~roger-mailler/publications/BIOSYSCOM2010.pdf>`__.

September 2011 - October 2013 **`Project Nemaload <http://nemaload.davidad.org/>`__ (`David Dalrymple <http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/144/26>`__)**.
The aim was to use optogenetics to record the firing dynamics of the
**C. elegans** neurons and then replicate it in a simulation. `He
delivered a lecture on the project in November
2011 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW77lANeJas>`__. As of June 2014
`he works for Twitter <https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=66199655>`__ so the project may now be defunct.
