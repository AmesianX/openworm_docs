Forking GitHub Repositories
===========================
On GitHub, click the Fork button on a project to create a "copy" that you can then modify independently. 

To fork an OpenWorm repository, go to https://github.com/openworm and hit the "Fork" button. GitHub will copy the repository to your account. This will copy the repo to your personal repository.  You can then make changes to the repository. Once you are done with the changes, hit the 'Pull Request' button on the repo page under your account. This will create a pull request asking the OpenWorm team to review, comment and merge the changes into the original repository.

For directions on doing this, check out the help page from GitHub.

Posting Gists (gist.github.com)

Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. All gists are Git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable from Git.  You can create a new gist here: https://gist.github.com/
