Mission/Vision
==============
OpenWorm is an open source project and open science community dedicated to creating the world's first whole organism in a computer, a *C. elegans* nematode, via bottom-up "systems biology" computational modeling. It is an association of highly motivated scientists and engineers who believe in Open Science and Open Access.

The complexity of computational neuroscience and biology make it extremely difficult to sort through the myriad facts, data, and biological processes that are uncovered on a daily basis by researchers around the world. 

OpenWorm believes that the challenges of solving brain simulation, even for the simplest of model organisms, require open access and collaborative solutions. 

OpenWorm is actively working to achieve  its goal  - creating the world's first virtual organism in a computer - by: 
* bringing together highly motivated scientists and engineers in the open space
* pushing away all the red tape by taking open science to the extreme
* fostering growth of a completely open computational biology community

Goal
====
Our main goal is to build the world's first virtual organism-- an in silico implementation of a living creature-- for the purpose of achieving an understanding of the events and mechanisms of living cells. Our secondary goal is to enable, via simulation, unprecedented  in silico experiments of living cells to power the next generation of advanced systems biology analysis, synthetic biology, computational drug discovery and dynamic disease modeling.

History
=======
Established in January 2011 and in just 2 years of activity, OpenWorm has built a community of 28 highly-motivated and highly-skilled individuals and coordinated their work. The community has produced regular scientific publications making extensive use of scientific research published through open access,  proving the validity of the open science approach taken.
