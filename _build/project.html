<h2>Mission/Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-vision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenWorm is an open source project and open science community dedicated to creating the world&#8217;s first whole organism in a computer, a <em>C. elegans</em> nematode, via bottom-up &#8220;systems biology&#8221; computational modeling. It is an association of highly motivated scientists and engineers who believe in Open Science and Open Access.</p>
<p>The complexity of computational neuroscience and biology make it extremely difficult to sort through the myriad facts, data, and biological processes that are uncovered on a daily basis by researchers around the world.</p>
<p>OpenWorm believes that the challenges of solving brain simulation, even for the simplest of model organisms, require open access and collaborative solutions.</p>
<p>OpenWorm is actively working to achieve  its goal  - creating the world&#8217;s first virtual organism in a computer - by:
* bringing together highly motivated scientists and engineers in the open space
* pushing away all the red tape by taking open science to the extreme
* fostering growth of a completely open computational biology community</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="goal">
<h2>Goal<a class="headerlink" href="#goal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our main goal is to build the world&#8217;s first virtual organism&#8211; an in silico implementation of a living creature&#8211; for the purpose of achieving an understanding of the events and mechanisms of living cells. Our secondary goal is to enable, via simulation, unprecedented  in silico experiments of living cells to power the next generation of advanced systems biology analysis, synthetic biology, computational drug discovery and dynamic disease modeling.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-do-this">
<h2>Why do this?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-this" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There has never been a scientific result in biology or neuroscience that is inconsistent with the idea that brains are 100% physical matter. We tend to forget, but our brains are tissues just like our lungs and heart are. If I could stick an electrode in your brain right now I could record activity from your neurons that corresponds with your thoughts. The problem is that scientists can&#8217;t understand what all that activity means yet.</p>
<p>Scientists can make models of sending a rocket to land on the surface of Mars, but not a model of all the activity of your brain. Scientists lack well-agreed upon models of complex neuronal activity because such models are hard to produce.</p>
<p>Complex neuronal activity is the result of countless interactions between molecules happening inside, between, and around neurons. Because of all the interactions that make up complex neuronal activity, you need to gather up a lot of information to make models of it. Also because of all those interactions, you need sophisticated software platforms to manage all that information properly.</p>
<p>We are building a simulation platform to prove it is possible to make good models of complex neuronal activity, starting with a digital worm. We are making the simulation platform open source because we believe anyone should be able to use it to understand how neurons and cells work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-models">
<h2>On models<a class="headerlink" href="#on-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Models are the cornerstone of science. Tools like algebra and calculus and newtonian mechanics and computer spreadsheets were advances because we could plug numbers into equations and get answers out that told us something about the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neuroscience has few predictive models for how nervous systems work.</p>
<p>We are starting by building a full simulation of a small biological system with a reasonable number of parts. We are focused on capturing as much of the rich detail of that biological system as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-c-elegans">
<h2>Why c. elegans?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-c-elegans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the field of neuroscience, one of the simplest organisms that are studied is the c. elegans. It only has 302 neurons, has a very consistent lifecycle, and is well studied. Its whole body has only 1000 cells total. With those 1000 cells it solves basic problems of feeding, mate-finding, predator and toxin avoidance using a nervous system driving muscles on a body in a complex world.</p>
<p>The cells in its body work together to produce its behavior. Instead of starting with the behavior and building a simple system to capture it, we are starting with making models of the individual cells and their interactions. If we do this correctly so that the cells act on each other as they do in the real organism, we will have a much more realistic model than we would get trying to go straight to the behavior.</p>
<p>This seems to us the only sensible starting point to creating a true biological simulation that captures enough details and has enough constraints to approximate real biology. Simulating a single cell that doesn&#8217;t move (like a yeast cell) isn&#8217;t going to provide us enough of a foundation to build up to more complex organisms by itself. If we can&#8217;t accomplish a simulation at this humble scale, we&#8217;ll never be able to do it at the massive scale of the human brain. The technology that would come out of this endeavor would be applicable to much more complex organisms down the road.</p>

<div class="section" id="history">
<h2>History<a class="headerlink" href="#history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Established in January 2011 and in just 2 years of activity, OpenWorm has built a community of 28 highly-motivated and highly-skilled individuals and coordinated their work. The community has produced regular scientific publications making extensive use of scientific research published through open access,  proving the validity of the open science approach taken.</p>
