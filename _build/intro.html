<h2>Welcome<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenWorm is an open source project and open science community dedicated to creating the world&#8217;s first whole organism
in a computer, a <em>C. elegans</em> nematode, via bottom-up &#8220;systems biology&#8221; computational modeling. It is an association
of highly motivated scientists and engineers who believe in Open Science and Open Access.

<h3>Top-down simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#top-down-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our first instincts when looking at a system we want to simulate is to come up with a list of its obvious features
and then try to pick the simplest means of simulating it.  In the case of obvious top-down ways to model a worm,
one might capture the fact that it bends in a sinusoidal pattern as a good starting point, and begin implementing
sine and cosine functions that can capture this.</p>
<p>There is an important place for this kind of simulation, but we have found that one rapidly runs into limitations
of generalization.  The model that worked great for crawling no longer works for turning around.  The simplest
thing possible is added to the model to make it work for turning around, but soon there is another aspect to
capture, and then another.  Soon, the model is a series of hacks that become increasingly brittle.</p>
<p>Instead of a pure top-down approach, we employ a balanced top-down, bottom-up approach, with a greater emphasis
on the bottom up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bottom-up-simulation">
<h3>Bottom-up simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#bottom-up-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Biology teaches us that when it comes to understanding how animals work, understanding the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology">behavior of cells is critical</a>.
Our bodies are made up of between 40 and 100 trillion cells, and it is these cells working
together that make up everything we are and do.  Of particular interest are the cells in the
brain and larger nervous system, that are responsible for our thoughts, creativity and feelings.</p>
<p>Today, science has barely scratched the surface of how to make best use of the enormous power of computers
to create models of cellular activity.  Scientists have not yet placed computer models of cells at the center
of biology.</p>
<p>A &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; simulation, in this case, is an attempt to model the individual cells in the organism, giving
them behaviors which, when combined together, produce the outward behavior of the entire organism.  This is as
opposed to building the organism without consideration for individual cells to start with, and adding cells in later.</p>
<p>In reality, we always have to do some bottom-up simulation along with top-down simulation, in order to make progress.
But in general and where possible, we view what we are doing as focused on simulating cells first.</p>

<div class="section" id="multi-algorithm-integration">
<h3>Multi-algorithm integration<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-algorithm-integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Just as mathematics has played a crucial role in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics">description of physics</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology">mathematicians have approached the field of biology</a>
with the goal of describing biological activity more precisely.  Generally speaking, this means that if it happens
inside a biological organism, there should be a set of equations that can explain how it works.  A great deal of
creativity goes into coming up with such equations.</p>
<p>Once equations have been determined, computers are great at calculating them once they have been
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">turned into algorithms</a>.  Algorithms become the computer&#8217;s way of
handling a bunch of equations.</p>
<p>The challenge is that there are a lot of equations that are necessary to fully specify how cellular activity works.
A <a class="reference external" href="https://simtk.org/home/wholecell">recent whole cell model</a> of a relatively simple cell came up with 32 algorithms
composed of many more equations and a ton of data.</p>
<p>The consequence of this from an engineering perspective is, in order to simulate complex living systems,
we  need software that is flexible enough to let us assemble the algorithms we need in just the right ways.
We call this &#8220;multi-algorithm integration&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-optimization">
<h3>Model optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#model-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a lot of aspects of the _c. <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">elegans_</span></a> that we will not be able to measure directly for a while based
on experimental limitations.  These are <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_parameter">&#8220;free parameters&#8221;</a>.
The conventional wisdom on modeling is to minimize the number of free parameters as much as possible.
Sometimes, the large number of free parameters are used as an argument to avoid making computational simulations.</p>
<p>In this case, we have to make do with what we have and make some good educated guesses about the free parameters.
There is a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">mathematical discipline that helps us do that known as optimization</a>.  For our purposes, you can think of this as generating
many different versions of a model, each version with slightly different parameters, and then measuring if the
model produces good results.  If a model produces better results by changing the parameters in a particular way,
you try to keep changing the parameters in that way and see if you get even better results.  In this way,
roughly speaking, optimization techniques enable scientists to turn a problem of lack of data into a problem
that a computer can address using brute force calculations.</p>

<div class="section" id="neuroml">
<h3>NeuroML<a class="headerlink" href="#neuroml" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuroML">NeuroML is</a> an XML (Extensible Markup Language) based model description
language that aims to provide a common data format for defining and exchanging models in computational neuroscience.
The focus of NeuroML is on models which are based on the biophysical and anatomical properties of real neurons.
(<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuroML">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>NeuroML is known as an open standard, because its means of describing a model is publicly available for
others to improve upon.</p>
